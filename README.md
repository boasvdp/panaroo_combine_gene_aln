# panaroo_combine_gene_aln

This repo contains a script adapted from Panaroo v1.5.2 which can be used to combine gene alignments, after aligning genes "on your own" (`--aligner none` option in Panaroo).

The code was copied from Panaroo and changed minimally to make it work as a separate step. The Panaroo license has been included.
